## AbLA Working Groups 

**Abolition in Special Collections** - The Abolition in Special Collections group is a collective of library workers in archives and special collections interested in disrupting our involvement with policing, armed response, surveillance, and the prison industrial complex. The group seeks to catalyse a cultural shift and to interrogate legacy practices and attitudes that perpetuate oppression. For more information, contact ablaspeccoll@gmail.com. To sign up for the group’s mailing list, visit https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/abolition-in-special-collections. 


**Resource List Working Group** - This group created [an annotated spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vTiWz-I4AX75Qgs7N7Cp6DqgANvv-E_31lnlizfjXrRczB0oY4NGlFO6DedXq_8HTMtbzxfnlGTp4jL/pubhtml) to support those looking for more information and resources on Police and Prison Abolition, Anti-Racism, Cyber Security, Organizing, Restorative and Transformative Justice, and information about other libraries and information spaces involved in police and prison divestment.
