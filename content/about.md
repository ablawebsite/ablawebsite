Abolitionist Library Association is a collective of library workers, students, and community members taking action to divest from all forms of policing in libraries and invest in our collective liberation. 

We envision a world without policing or prisons. Our goal is to create libraries that are rooted in community self-determination and intellectual freedom through collective action. We will achieve this goal by:

* Establishing a network of library and information workers to support each other in doing divestment work.

* Providing a space for idea-sharing, strategy, and support for abolition in libraries

* Creating and sharing resources about ending police involvement in information spaces and everywhere to achieve real community safety rooted in transformative justice 

* Pressuring stakeholders and decision-makers to divest from police
