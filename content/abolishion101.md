Abolition basics 

Just point to a couple of things (3-4) here? If so, what things? Here are some ideas others shared:


* that Mariame Kaba essay everybody links to (this one?)
* a LibGuide on abolition from Northwestern (s/o to Josh!)
* *If you’re new to abolition study group guide* and *An Indigenous abolitionist study guide (link)*(these are both a little bigger but broken down by topic if there’s anything we want to be sure to cover)
* Abolitionist toolkit from Critical Resistance that includes “tools for framing abolitionist arguments in terms of what we want”  (link)
* Survived & Punished, which includes organizing and advocacy resources on their website -nr
